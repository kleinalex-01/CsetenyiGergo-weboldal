This guide will walk you through deploying your website to mhosting.hu using cPanel.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- ‚úÖ **Build completed successfully** (`npm run build` - creates the `dist` folder)

- ‚úÖ **Domain name** configured to point to mhosting.hu servers
- ‚úÖ All files in the `dist` folder ready to upload

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Access cPanel

1. Go to your mhosting.hu cPanel URL (usually `yourdomain.com/cpanel` or provided by hosting)
2. Enter your **username** and **password**
3. Click **Log in**

### Step 2: Navigate to File Manager

1. In cPanel, scroll down to the **"Files"** section
2. Click on **"File Manager"**
3. A new window/tab will open with your file browser

### Step 3: Navigate to public_html

1. In the left sidebar, click on **`public_html`** folder
2. This is where your website files need to be uploaded
3. **IMPORTANT:** If there are existing files in `public_html`:
   - Select all files (checkbox at the top)
   - Click **"Delete"** button
   - Confirm deletion
   - This ensures a clean installation

### Step 4: Upload Your Website Files

#### Option A: Using Upload (For Individual Files)

1. Click the **"Upload"** button at the top
2. Click **"Select File"** or drag files into the upload area
3. Navigate to your local `dist` folder: `C:\Users\Asus\Desktop\Projects\csetenyigergo\dist`
4. Upload **ALL** files and folders:
   - `index.html`
   - `.htaccess` ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL - Don't skip this!**
   - `assets/` folder
   - `images/` folder
   - `manifest.webmanifest`
   - `registerSW.js`
   - `sw.js`
   - `workbox-*.js`
   - `robots.txt`
   - `sitemap.xml`
   - Any other files in dist

#### Option B: Using ZIP Upload (Recommended - Faster)

1. **On your local machine:**
   - Navigate to `C:\Users\Asus\Desktop\Projects\csetenyigergo\dist`
   - Select **ALL contents** (Ctrl+A)
   - Right-click ‚Üí **Send to ‚Üí Compressed (zipped) folder**
   - Name it `website.zip`

2. **In cPanel File Manager:**
   - Make sure you're in `public_html`
   - Click **"Upload"** button
   - Select `website.zip` and upload it
   - Wait for upload to complete (100%)
   - Go back to File Manager

3. **Extract the ZIP:**
   - In `public_html`, find `website.zip`
   - Right-click on `website.zip`
   - Select **"Extract"**
   - Confirm extraction path is `/public_html`
   - Click **"Extract File(s)"**
   - After extraction completes, **delete** `website.zip` (not needed anymore)

### Step 5: Verify .htaccess File

**CRITICAL STEP - Do not skip!**

1. In `public_html`, look for **`.htaccess`** file
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è If you don't see it, click **"Settings"** (top right) ‚Üí Check **"Show Hidden Files (dotfiles)"**
2. The `.htaccess` file should be visible now
3. **Verify it was uploaded:**
   - Right-click `.htaccess` ‚Üí **"View"**
   - Check that it contains Apache configuration (mod_rewrite, headers, etc.)
   - Should start with `<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>`

### Step 6: Set File Permissions

1. **For the `.htaccess` file:**
   - Right-click `.htaccess`
   - Select **"Change Permissions"**
   - Set to **644** (User: Read/Write, Group: Read, World: Read)
   - Click **"Change Permissions"**

2. **For all folders** (`assets`, `images`):
   - Right-click each folder
   - Select **"Change Permissions"**
   - Set to **755** (User: Read/Write/Execute, Group: Read/Execute, World: Read/Execute)
   - ‚úÖ Check **"Recurse into subdirectories"**
   - Click **"Change Permissions"**

3. **For all files** (`index.html`, `*.js`, `*.css`, etc.):
   - Select all files (not folders)
   - Right-click ‚Üí **"Change Permissions"**
   - Set to **644**

**Quick Permissions Reference:**
```
Files:    644 (rw-r--r--)
Folders:  755 (rwxr-xr-x)
```

### Step 7: Configure SSL Certificate

1. **Go back to cPanel main page**
2. Scroll to **"Security"** section
3. Click **"SSL/TLS Status"**
4. Find your domain in the list
5. Click **"Run AutoSSL"** or **"Install SSL"**
6. Wait for SSL certificate to be installed (may take a few minutes)
7. Verify SSL is active (look for green padlock icon)

**Alternative Method:**
- Contact mhosting.hu support to enable free Let's Encrypt SSL
- They can activate it for you within minutes

### Step 8: Test Your Website

1. **Open your website in a browser:**
   - Go to `https://yourdomain.com` (use HTTPS!)
   - The `.htaccess` file will automatically redirect HTTP to HTTPS

2. **Test all pages:**
   - ‚úÖ Home page loads correctly
   - ‚úÖ Services page loads
   - ‚úÖ Gallery page loads with all images
   - ‚úÖ Contact page loads

3. **Test functionality:**
   - ‚úÖ Dark mode toggle works
   - ‚úÖ Mobile menu opens/closes
   - ‚úÖ Gallery lightbox works
   - ‚úÖ Contact form submits (check rate limiting)
   - ‚úÖ All images load correctly
   - ‚úÖ Navigation works between pages

4. **Test security headers:**
   - Go to https://securityheaders.com
   - Enter your domain
   - Should show **A** or **A+** rating
   - Verify headers like CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options are present

### Step 9: Performance Testing

1. **Google PageSpeed Insights:**
   - Go to https://pagespeed.web.dev
   - Enter your domain
   - Check scores for Mobile and Desktop
   - Should see good scores (aim for 90+)

2. **GTmetrix:**
   - Go to https://gtmetrix.com
   - Enter your domain
   - Check loading times and optimization scores

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: 404 Error on Pages (Services, Gallery, Contact)

**Cause:** `.htaccess` file not working or missing

**Solution:**
1. Verify `.htaccess` exists in `public_html`
2. Check file permissions are 644
3. Contact mhosting.hu support to enable `mod_rewrite` module
4. Test `.htaccess` is working:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/test-path
   ```
   Should show your site (not 404), thanks to SPA routing

### Issue: HTTPS Not Working / SSL Certificate Error

**Cause:** SSL not installed or misconfigured

**Solution:**
1. In cPanel ‚Üí SSL/TLS Status ‚Üí Run AutoSSL
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Contact mhosting.hu support if issue persists

### Issue: Images Not Loading / 404 on Assets

**Cause:** Files not uploaded correctly or wrong paths

**Solution:**
1. Verify `images/` folder exists in `public_html`
2. Check folder permissions are 755
3. Verify file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
4. Re-upload the `images/` folder if needed

### Issue: Dark Mode Not Persisting / LocalStorage Errors

**Cause:** Browser blocking localStorage or cookies

**Solution:**
1. This is handled in the code with try-catch blocks
2. Ask users to enable cookies/localStorage in browser settings
3. Test in incognito mode to verify functionality

### Issue: Contact Form Not Sending Emails

**Cause:** PHP mail() function or email configuration

**Solution:**
1. Your current setup uses `mailto:` links (not PHP forms)
2. This opens user's email client - no server-side configuration needed
3. If you want server-side form handling, contact mhosting.hu support

### Issue: Website Shows Old Content / Not Updating

**Cause:** Browser cache or service worker cache

**Solution:**
1. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Clear browser cache**
3. **Clear service worker:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application tab
   - Click "Service Workers"
   - Click "Unregister"
4. If issue persists for all users, update `version` in `manifest.webmanifest`
