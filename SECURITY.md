## 🛡️ Security Best Practices (Maintained)

### What's Already Good:

✅ **No Backend API Keys in Frontend**  
Your site is static with no backend integration, which eliminates many attack vectors.

✅ **Email Protection**  
Using mailto: links instead of exposing email directly on the page.

✅ **Modern Framework**  
React 19 with latest security patches.

✅ **No Third-Party Analytics**  
No tracking scripts that could compromise privacy.

✅ **PWA Security**  
Service worker follows secure practices.
